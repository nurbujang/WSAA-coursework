Assignment for Web Services and Applications (Spring 2024)
assignment03-cso.py
Author: Nur Bujang

Write a program that retrieves the dataset for the "exchequer account (historical series)" from the CSO, and stores it into a file called "cso.json".

    Upload this program to the same repository you used for the XML assignment
    Save this assignment as "assignment03-cso.py"
    This program should not be a long one
        I don't need you to reformat or analyse the data in any way
        It should be about 10ish lines long (I have not counted)
    You will need to find the dataset in CSO.ie, try economic and then finance, then finance indicators. 
    Yes it is difficult to find, that is part of the task, actually the easiest way to find it is search for it.

Save your program in the repository you used for the first assignment (I will be correcting all these at the end of the semester)

You do not need to over comment your code.
