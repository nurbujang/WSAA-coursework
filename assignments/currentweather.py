Assignment for Web Services and Applications (Spring 2024)
currentweather.py
Author: Nur Bujang

Using the URL below:
https://api.open-meteo.com/v1/forecast?latitude=53.82&longitude=-9.5&current=temperature_2m

Write a python program called currentweather.py that will print out the current temperature on the console (and only the temperature).
I have set the lat/long to my location, you may use that or a different location.

Last few marks:
Look at the documentation (below) and print out the current wind direction (10m) as well.

üå§Ô∏è Free Open-Source Weather API | Open-Meteo.com (https://open-meteo.com/)

Save the file into your assignments directory (or you can make a separate repo for it, I do not mind).
Copy a link to the directory/repo to here (please only put a link in here, other information can be in the readme)
