# Create a Web application in Flask that has a RESTful API.
# The application should link to one or more database tables.
# You should also create the web pages that can consume the API. 
# I.e. performs CRUD operations on the data.

# Description:
# A rehash of the sample project lab 
# i.e. A basic Flask server that has a:
#     1. REST API, (to perform CRUD operations)
#     2. One database table and
#     3. Accompanying web interface, using AJAX calls, to perform these CRUD operations

#### 10 marks if you use pythonanywhere
# ▪ Make it look nice
# ▪ Have more than one database table
# ▪ Link to an outside data source and either:
#     • Save the data into a database table that you view elsewhere in your application.
#     • Manipulate/analyse the data in real time.
# ▪ Hosted your application online (e.g. Azure, Pythonanywhere).
#     • Be warned that some free hosting does not allow access to third party systems
# ▪ Perform more than CRUD operations on your data
